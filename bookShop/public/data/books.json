It has a fair amount in common with Pride and Prejudice, but Emma is a less obviously likeable heroine than Lizzy, who is somewhat deluded in her matchmaking schemes. But this makes for the novelâ€™s real joy; enjoying the incredibly clever way Austen contrasts what we know to be true about Emma with how she herself perceives her own story.",

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love - and its threatened loss - the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.",
